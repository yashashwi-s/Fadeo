# Fadeo — Architecture & Build Plan

> Your Mac plays the right sound for what you're doing, automatically — and you
> control exactly how "right" is defined, down to the app, the desktop, and the second.

**Platform:** macOS 14+ (target macOS 26 "Tahoe"). Native Swift / SwiftUI.
**Shape:** a *full application* (real main window, deep preferences, workspace editor)
**plus** a lightweight menu-bar companion for at-a-glance control.
**Distribution:** open source, direct-download, Developer-ID signed & notarized;
**paid license with WinRAR-style soft nags** (fully functional unlicensed).

---

## 0. The pillars are hard constraints, not goals

1. **High customizability** — nothing hardcoded. Every trigger, timing value, fade
   curve, precedence rule, and fallback is *data*, never an assumption baked into code.
   The resolution core is a pure function over that data.
2. **High efficiency** — a daemon that runs all day must be invisible in Activity
   Monitor. **Target: idle CPU ≈ 0.0%, resident memory single-digit MB headless, zero
   polling in steady state.** Every choice below is filtered through this.
3. **It's a product people pay for** — best-in-class depth *and* polish. Open source,
   but the official signed build is licensed (soft nag, never a functional lockout).

These pull the same way: a data-driven, event-driven design is simultaneously the most
customizable (sensors/actuators exist only when a rule needs them) and the cheapest
(nothing runs unless the OS pushes an event).

---

## 1. Product shape — one binary, two surfaces

| Surface | What it is | When it's shown |
|---|---|---|
| **Main app window** | Full SwiftUI app: dashboard, **workspace editor**, sound library, precedence & transitions, triggers, preferences, energy dashboard, advanced YAML editor, license | when the user opens it |
| **Menu-bar companion** | `MenuBarExtra`: current workspace + what's playing, play/pause + volume, snooze automation, manual override, quick workspace toggles, live context line | always (agent) |

**Dual activation policy (the key trick):** the process runs as `.accessory`
(menu-bar-only agent, no Dock icon, App-Nap-friendly) in steady state. When the main
window opens, it flips to `.regular` (Dock icon, full app, menus); when the last window
closes it flips back to `.accessory`. **This satisfies "a real full app" and "an
invisible background daemon" at the same time** — no compromise.

---

## 2. What the research established (the four load-bearing findings)

| # | Finding | Consequence |
|---|---------|-------------|
| **1** | Since **macOS 15.4**, `mediaremoted` enforces entitlements: third-party apps can't **read** now-playing (`MRMediaRemoteGetNowPlayingInfo`→nil), but **commands still work** (`MRMediaRemoteSendCommand`: play/pause/next/volume). Reading needs [`ungive/mediaremote-adapter`](https://github.com/ungive/mediaremote-adapter): shell to `/usr/bin/perl` (implicitly entitled via `com.apple.*` id), stream JSON. BSD-3, Swift-callable. | We **control** playback for free; reading current track is **lazy & optional**. |
| **2** | Detecting **which** Space you're on needs private APIs (`CGSCopyManagedDisplaySpaces`); symbols drift across releases. Public notification only says *a* space changed. | Space-by-index lives behind a **version-guarded shim** that degrades gracefully. |
| **3** | **Notarization does NOT scan for private APIs** — only App Store *review* does. A Developer-ID, notarized, **non-sandboxed** app may use the Perl adapter, private CGS APIs, Accessibility. | Distribution = direct download + notarize. App Store would kill half the triggers. |
| **4** | Every v1 trigger is **event-driven / push** — including "in a meeting" (observe CoreMediaIO/CoreAudio *usage* → **no camera/mic permission prompt**). | Detection layer runs **zero-polling** in steady state — the whole basis of Activity-Monitor invisibility. |

### Trigger cost table (v1 bolded)

| Trigger | API | Model | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Frontmost app** | `NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification` | push | ~free |
| **Space / desktop** | `activeSpaceDidChangeNotification` + private CGS read | push | ~free |
| **In a meeting** | CoreMediaIO cam + CoreAudio mic `…IsRunningSomewhere` listeners | push | ~free, no TCC prompt |
| **Focus / DND** | FSEvents watch on `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/Assertions.json` | push | ~free |
| **Time / schedule** | one `DispatchSourceTimer` → next rule boundary, large tolerance | 1 coalesced wake | ~free |
| Idle · Browser URL · Network/SSID · Battery · Headphones · Calendar *(later)* | CGEventSource · AX/AppleScript · CoreWLAN · IOPM · IOBluetooth · EventKit | push / lazy | ~free / on-demand |

```

**Workspaces are the user-facing model; they *compile* to the resolver's inputs.** The
GUI edits Workspaces (intuitive); a power user can edit the same thing as YAML. Both
lower to one representation the pure resolver evaluates. This is how we get friendly
*and* infinitely customizable without two engines.

---

## 4. The Workspace model (the user-facing concept)

A **Workspace** is a named context with a sound behavior. Example: *Deep Work*,
*Design*, *Gaming*, *Meetings*, *Reading*.

```yaml
# ~/Library/Application Support/Fadeo/config.yaml  (source of truth; hot-reloaded)
version: 1
settings:
  evaluationDebounceMs: 300
  tiebreak: [stickiness, specificity, priority, recency]   # user-orderable
  fallback: keepCurrent          # keepCurrent | resumePrevious | silence
  fallbackFadeMs: 1500
  defaults: { fadeInMs: 800, fadeOutMs: 800, crossfadeMs: 1200,
              enterDelayMs: 1200, exitDelayMs: 400, minDwellMs: 15000 }

workspaces:
  - id: deep-work
    name: "Deep Work"
    color: "#67E4D2"
    priority: 80                 # explicit rank (tiebreak fallback)
    match:                       # ALL listed dimensions must hold (configurable any/all)
      apps:
        - { bundle: "com.apple.dt.Xcode", strength: strong }
        - { bundle: "com.microsoft.VSCode", strength: strong }
        - { bundle: "com.tinyspeck.slackmacgap", strength: weak }   # won't yank you in
      spaces: [1]                # optional extra constraint → raises specificity
      focus: ["work"]            # optional
      timeBetween: ["09:00","18:00"]
    sound:
      source: "internal:preset:brown-noise"
      volume: 0.6
      perApp:                    # optional overrides for a member app
        "com.apple.dt.Xcode": { volume: 0.7 }
    timing: { fadeInMs: 1200, minDwellMs: 20000 }   # overrides defaults

  - id: meetings
    name: "Meetings"
    override: true               # OVERRIDE BAND — pre-empts everything while it matches
    match: { meeting: true }     # camera OR mic live (configurable)
    sound: { action: pause, fadeOutMs: 300 }

  - id: gaming
    name: "Gaming"
    priority: 50
    match: { apps: [{ bundle: "com.valvesoftware.steam", strength: strong }] }
    sound: { source: "external:spotify:playlist:37i9dQ...", volume: 0.5, crossfadeMs: 1500 }
```

**Anatomy of a workspace:** identity (name/color/icon), **match** (which apps / spaces /
times / focus / meeting activate it), **sound** (source + volume + action), optional
**per-app overrides**, optional **timing** overrides, **priority**, and two special
flags: `override` (pre-empt band) and per-app `strength` (`strong` vs `weak`).

**Sources** (any workspace): `external:spotify:playlist:<id>`, `external:appleMusic:<id>`,
`external:command` (just play/pause whatever's playing), `internal:file:<path>`,
`internal:folder:<path>`, `internal:playlist:<id>`, `internal:preset:<name>` (rain /
brown-noise / lofi / …). **Actions:** `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `setVolume`, `duck`,
`resumePrevious`, `doNothing`.

**Source philosophy — DECIDED: bring-your-own first.** The core attitude is *your* sound:
your Spotify/Apple Music playlists and your own files/folders. We *also* bundle a small
royalty-free **starter set** (rain, brown/pink noise, lo-fi loops) so a fresh install
makes sound immediately — but BYO is the headline, presets are the on-ramp.

**Local playback — DECIDED, implemented: three granularities, so "your own files" means
exactly what the user wants it to mean, not just "one file":**
- `internal:file:<path>` — a single file.
- `internal:folder:<path>` — every supported audio file in that folder (non-recursive),
  in filename order or shuffled.
- `internal:playlist:<id>` — a **user-curated subset** of specific files, referenced by
  id against `Config.localPlaylists` (`LocalPlaylist { id, name, paths }`). This is the
  "select a few tracks from a folder" case — an explicit, user-picked list rather than a
  filter rule, so it's exactly as customizable as the user wants (a GUI picker to build
  these lands with the Sound Library pane in M4; the data model exists now).

**Playback order & repeat — genuine per-workspace controls, not hardcoded**, via
`Sound.order` (`sequential` | `shuffle`) and `Sound.repeatMode` (`off` | `one` | `all`,
default `all` so ambient folders/playlists loop naturally). Only meaningful for
multi/single-file internal sources; ignored for presets and external sources (those apps
manage their own playback order).

Streaming (Spotify/Apple Music) and local playback are peers, not alternatives — a
workspace picks whichever `source` fits, and different workspaces can freely mix the two
(e.g. "Deep Work" plays a local folder, "Commute" plays a Spotify playlist).

---

## 5. Precedence & conflict resolution — the deep problem, solved

**The situation you raised:** the same app can belong to two workspaces. You're in
Workspace **C** (its music playing). You switch to app **X**, which is a member of
**A** *and* **B** (not C). Which workspace wins, and what should the audio do?

Resolution runs as **four ordered bands**; the answer is deterministic *and* tuned for
least surprise:

### Band 1 — Override (pre-emptive)
Any workspace flagged `override: true` whose match holds wins outright, ignoring
everything else. Default: *Meetings* (`meeting: true`). → "Instant mute the second a
call starts" always beats app/space workspaces. When the override stops matching, we
fall back through the lower bands (and typically **resume** what was playing).

### Band 2 — Candidate set
Collect every non-override workspace whose `match` currently holds. Membership requires
the frontmost app be a member **and** any extra constraints (space/time/focus) hold.
- **0 candidates →** Band 4 (Fallback).
- **1 candidate →** it's active. Done.
- **>1 →** Band 3.

### Band 3 — Tiebreak chain (user-orderable; default below)
Apply strategies in order until one workspace wins:

1. **Stickiness (continuity).** If the *currently active* workspace is still a
   candidate, **keep it** — don't change the music just because you tabbed to a shared
   app. *(In your scenario C is NOT a candidate — X∉C — so stickiness doesn't fire, and
   we correctly proceed to choose between A and B.)*
2. **Specificity.** The workspace whose match is *more constrained* wins — more matched
   dimensions = more intentional (app+space+time ⟩ app-only). If A also pins "Space 1"
   and you're on Space 1, **A beats B** (app-only). Usually "the workspace that cares
   most about this exact situation."
3. **Priority.** Explicit user rank (drag to order). Decides genuine ties where A and B
   list only the app. Whatever you ranked higher wins — total user control.
4. **Recency.** Most-recently-active of the candidates ("do what I did last time").
   Off by default (can surprise); opt-in.
5. **Stable id.** Final deterministic tiebreak so behavior is *never* random.

### Band 4 — Fallback (no candidate)
Governed by `settings.fallback`:
- **`keepCurrent`** (default) — inertia: keep whatever's sounding. → *"I tabbed to an
  app no workspace claims; don't disrupt my flow."*
- **`resumePrevious`** — restore the last external track/state.
- **`silence`** — fade out.

### The `weak` membership knob (the elegant answer to "shared apps shouldn't yank me")
A member app can be `strength: weak` (a.k.a. *ambient*). A weak member **activates its
workspace only if no other workspace is already active** — it never pulls you *out* of
your current context. So marking Slack/Notes/Finder as `weak` across workspaces means
tabbing to them from Deep Work **keeps Deep Work's music**, while `strong` members do
switch context. `strong` (default) + `weak` + `keepCurrent` fallback cover essentially
every "minute" preference about disruption.

### Worked example (your exact case), fully determined
> In **C** (music C). Switch to **X ∈ {A, B}**, X∉C.
> 1. No override matches. 2. C drops out (X∉C); candidates = {A,B}. 3. Tiebreak:
>    stickiness N/A (C not a candidate) → specificity: if only A also matches your
>    current Space/time, **A wins**; else → priority: your rank decides. 4. Transition
>    C→A uses A's `fadeInMs`/`crossfadeMs` and C's `fadeOutMs` (or the global transition
>    style). If instead you'd rather X *not* change anything, mark X `weak` in A and B →
>    with `keepCurrent`, **C's music simply continues**.

### Trust: the Conflict Inspector / Simulator
Because these are "minute points," the UI must make them legible:
- **Live "why this workspace" line** on the dashboard: *"Deep Work — won by specificity
  (Space 1) over Gaming."*
- **Simulator** in Precedence settings: pick a hypothetical context (app + space + time
  + meeting) → see which workspace would win and *which band/strategy decided it*, before
  it ever happens. This is what makes deep precedence usable instead of mysterious.

---

## 6. Timing & transitions (deep customization surface)

Every timing value exists at **global default** level and is **overridable per
workspace** (and, where sensible, per app-in-workspace):

| Knob | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fadeInMs` / `fadeOutMs` | ramp when a workspace's sound starts / stops |
| `crossfadeMs` | overlap when switching source A→B |
| `enterDelayMs` | **grace** — ignore a context that lasts < this (don't react to a 1s tab-through) |
| `exitDelayMs` | linger before acting on leaving |
| `minDwellMs` | **hysteresis** — hold a workspace ≥ this before it can be switched away (anti-flap) |
| transition style | per-pair: `crossfade` \| `fadeOutThenIn` \| `hardCut` |
| fade **curve** | linear \| equal-power \| exponential (visual editor; ties to the waveform-taper brand motif) |

Combined with `evaluationDebounceMs`, these absorb rapid app-switch bursts so the audio
never thrashes. All user-tunable; sensible defaults ship.

---

## 6a. Volume model: system-consistent, not async (core feature)

**Goal:** Fadeo's loudness must feel like part of the system, not a second, drifting
volume the user has to reconcile. Per-sound and per-app levels are set once as a *mix*;
turning the overall level up or down moves the *actual macOS system volume*, not a hidden
Fadeo-only gain.

**Research facts that decide the design:**
- macOS scales every app's output by the **system output volume at the hardware/device
  layer**, so Fadeo's `AVAudioEngine` output is *already* affected by the system volume.
  We must **not** multiply by it again in software (that would double-apply it).
- The system volume is readable/writable via CoreAudio
  **`kAudioHardwareServiceDeviceProperty_VirtualMainVolume`** on the default output device,
  and observable via `AudioObjectAddPropertyListenerBlock` (event-driven, no polling).
- macOS has **no public per-app output-volume API**; true per-app mixing needs a virtual
  audio device (BackgroundMusic-style). References for the UX: **Sound Control** and
  **SoundSource** (they do per-app volume but not context switching). So for *external*
  players we set that app's own `sound volume` (Spotify/Music via AppleScript); for our
  *internal* engine we control our own gain.

**Three-layer model:**

1. **Per-source / per-app baseline (the mix)** — a relative `0…1` set beforehand, per
   source and per member app (`Sound.volume` + `perApp`). "brown-noise sits at 0.6",
   "rain at 0.45", "Xcode a touch louder". This is Fadeo-relative and never touches the
   system volume, so you can balance your soundscape without turning the whole Mac up.
2. **Perceptual calibration (per source)** — a fixed per-source correction so equal
   baseline numbers *sound* equally loud (white noise is perceptually much louder than
   brown at the same RMS). Applied automatically; makes "60%" mean the same thing across
   sources. Internal presets ship with a calibration table; files/external default to 1.0
   with optional measured normalization later.
3. **Master = the macOS system volume (single source of truth).** Fadeo reads it, observes
   it live, and its own volume control *sets the system volume*. There is no independent
   async master. Effective loudness = `baseline × calibration` (our engine gain) `×
   systemVolume` (applied by the hardware). So when you nudge Fadeo's level, or hit the
   volume keys, or drag the menu-bar slider, they are all the same knob.

**Settings:** `linkMasterToSystemVolume` (default **on** — the behavior above). Off is an
advanced escape hatch that applies a Fadeo-only software master (explicitly the "async"
mode the user did *not* want, offered only for completeness). Optional
`ensureAudibleOnPlay` (nudge system volume up to a floor if it's at zero when autoplay
starts) is **off** by default (never grab the volume unasked).

**Surfaces:** a menu-bar volume slider bound to the system volume; per-source/per-app
baseline sliders in the Workspace editor (M4). External-player baselines map to that
app's own volume (M2).

---

## 7. Data model (pure core)

```swift
struct Context {                 // one merged snapshot the resolver reasons over
    var frontmostApp: String?    // bundle id
    var frontmostWindowTitle: String?      // later (AX)
    var activeSpace: SpaceRef?   // {display, index?, uuid} — index nil if shim degraded
    var cameraActive, micActive: Bool
    var inMeeting: Bool          // derived, configurable (cam && / || mic)
    var focusMode: String?       // "work" | "personal" | nil
    var localTime: Date
    var idleSeconds: TimeInterval?          // later
    var stamp: Date
}

struct Decision {                // resolver output
    var activeWorkspace: WorkspaceID?
    var target: AudioTarget      // source + volume + action
    var transition: Transition   // fades / crossfade / delay
    var reason: ResolutionTrace  // which band/strategy decided — for the inspector
}

func resolve(_ ctx: Context, _ ws: [Workspace], _ s: Settings) -> Decision   // PURE
```

The resolver, the tiebreak chain, YAML (de)serialization, and validation live in
`FadeoCore` and are **100% unit-tested with zero OS dependencies** — feed a Context,
assert a Decision. That test suite *is* the guarantee behind the customizability pillar.

---

## 8. Actuators

**`ExternalConductor`** — conducts the player you already use.
- Transport (play/pause/next/volume, system-wide): `MRMediaRemoteSendCommand` — no
  entitlement needed, the reliable path.
- App-specific (switch to a named Spotify/Music item; ramp *that app's* volume for a
  fade): ScriptingBridge / AppleScript.
- **Read** current track (only for rules like "don't override if already playing"): lazy
  `mediaremote-adapter` Perl stream — spawned on demand, torn down after. Bundled in
  `Fadeo.app/Contents/Resources/`.
- Keeps its own desired-state tracker to survive AppleScript flakiness (never depends on
  reading back).

**`InternalEngine`** — self-contained player.
- `AVAudioEngine` + player node(s) + mixer; local files + bundled ambient presets;
  gapless loop; fades via mixer `outputVolume` ramp; crossfade via two nodes.
- **Deallocated when idle** — no workspace wants internal audio → engine stopped, HAL
  released → 0% CPU.

Only actuators referenced by active workspaces are instantiated.

---

## 9. Config system (GUI ⇄ file, two-way, hot-reload)

- **Source of truth:** `~/Library/Application Support/Fadeo/config.yaml` — readable,
  comment-friendly, version-controllable, schema-versioned.
- **GUI → file:** editor mutates in-memory model → atomic write.
- **File → app:** FSEvents watch → parse → **validate** → hot-swap atomically. On error:
  **keep last-good config**, show a clear banner (never crash, never silently break).
- Conflict policy: last-writer-wins, always validated. A bad edit can't take down the
  daemon or leave audio undefined.

---

## 10. App structure & UI

**Main window — sidebar navigation:**

| Pane | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Now / Dashboard** | current workspace + what's playing; live context (app · space · meeting · focus · time); **"why this workspace" trace**; manual override |
| **Workspaces** | list + editor: name/color/icon; **add apps** (picker, drag, or "capture frontmost"); spaces/time/focus/meeting constraints; source; volume; **per-app strength & overrides**; timing overrides |
| **Sound Library** | connect Spotify/Apple Music; add local files/folders; ambient presets; preview |
| **Precedence & Transitions** | drag-order the **tiebreak chain**; fallback behavior; global fades/delays/dwell; transition style + **fade-curve editor**; **Conflict Simulator** |
| **Triggers** | enable/disable sensors; define "meeting" (cam and/or mic); name your Spaces |
| **Preferences** | general; launch at login (`SMAppService`); updates (Sparkle); **Energy dashboard** (live CPU/events — the efficiency proof); permissions status & re-request; backup/export |
| **Advanced** | raw **YAML editor** (two-way); import/export; rule inspector; logs |
| **About / License** | logo; version; license status; buy/activate; OSS repo link; the soft nag |

**Menu-bar companion (`MenuBarExtra`) — simple yet genuinely useful:**
current workspace + what's playing · play/pause + volume slider · **snooze automation**
(15m / 1h / until tomorrow / until quit) · **manual override** to a workspace (once /
for 1h / until context changes) · toggle a workspace on/off · live context line
(app · space · meeting) · **Open Fadeo** (→ flips to `.regular`, opens main window).

---

## 11. Efficiency engineering — the "invisible in Activity Monitor" contract

Per Apple's [Energy Efficiency Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/index.html):

1. **Zero polling in steady state** — all OS push (`NSWorkspace`, CoreMediaIO/CoreAudio
   listeners, FSEvents, Space-change). Only timer = schedule sensor's single
   next-boundary `DispatchSourceTimer` (large `tolerance`), disarmed when no time rule.
2. **Lazy sensors & actuators** — start only sensors whose fields some enabled workspace
   references; disabled = zero observers = zero cost.
3. **Debounced/coalesced evaluation** — rapid app-switch bursts → one `resolve`.
4. **Reconciler emits only diffs** — no redundant AppleScript/IPC.
5. **`AVAudioEngine` torn down when unused** — releases HAL, 0% CPU.
6. **App-Nap-friendly** — `.accessory` in steady state; no `beginActivity` unless audio
   is actually playing; registered OS events still wake us.
7. **Perl adapter only while a read-rule is active** — short-lived / streamed, then killed.
8. **Sleep/wake** — tear down engine on `willSleep`; re-read context + re-evaluate on
   `didWake`.
9. **No web view, no Electron, single process.** Main window created lazily, released on
   close (→ back to `.accessory`).
10. **Self-instrumentation** — Energy dashboard shows live events/sec + current Context,
    so a runaway observer is caught immediately.

**Ship gate:** idle CPU ≈ 0.0% over 10 min; RSS < ~15 MB headless, < ~40 MB with window
open; no Fadeo-attributable wakeups in `powermetrics` while idle.

---

## 12. Permissions & entitlements

| Capability | Mechanism | Prompt? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontmost app / Space | `NSWorkspace` notifications | No | free |
| Camera/mic **in-use** | CoreMediaIO / CoreAudio device properties | **No** | observing usage ≠ capturing → no TCC |
| Focus / DND | read `~/Library/DoNotDisturb/DB/Assertions.json` | No | user-readable |
| Control Spotify / Music | AppleEvents / ScriptingBridge | **Yes** (Automation) | `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription`; onboarding explains |
| Window title / URL *(later)* | Accessibility (`AXUIElement`) | **Yes** (Accessibility) | wizard deep-links the pane |
| Login start | `SMAppService` (macOS 13+) | No | modern; no hand-written plist |
| MediaRemote cmds / adapter read | private framework via Perl | No | unsandboxed; not App-Store-eligible |

Hardened runtime, non-sandboxed. First-run wizard requests **only what enabled
workspaces need** (no Automation prompt if no external-player workspace exists).

---

## 13. Licensing, trial & monetization (open source + WinRAR-style soft nag)

**Nothing is ever gated by a premium tier — every feature works from first launch,
forever.** Payment funds development and clears the nag; it never unlocks functionality.

- **Price: $2 lifetime.** Deliberately trivial — impulse-cheap, honor-system, "just pay
  the $2." One-time, no subscription.
- **14-day trial, then soft nags.** After 14 days, an unlicensed copy shows a gentle,
  dismissible reminder (on-launch, occasional; plus a quiet "unlicensed" pill in About).
  **Never interrupts audio, never fires during a meeting/Focus** (Fadeo of all apps must
  respect that).
- **The nag offers two ways to make it go away:**
  1. **Buy the $2 lifetime license**, or
  2. **Answer a short survey + opt into anonymous usage diagnostics.** Either path
     satisfies the nag. This trades "money" for "feedback + signal", so users who won't
     pay still help the product, and the developer gets real usage insight.
- **Free-license giveaway (launch gimmick):** for a limited window, `puremac.yashashwi.me/fadeo`
  shows a **"Generate free lifetime license"** button, **capped at the first ~100**. Those
  keys are ordinary offline licenses — permanent, no nag.
- **Offline validation.** License = an **Ed25519-signed blob**; the app bundles the public
  key and verifies locally. **No phone-home at runtime** (privacy + zero background network
  cost). Online only at the moment of purchase / free-key generation / manual refresh.
- **License-of-source: DECIDED — GPLv3** + a separate paid key for the official binary
  ("open core / paid convenience & support"). `LICENSE` (GPLv3) committed from day one.
- Licensing module stays tiny and offline — **no** steady-state cost.

### 13a. Usage diagnostics (opt-in, privacy-first)
- **Opt-in from first run** (offered in onboarding) *and* toggleable anytime in Preferences
  — and it's one of the two nag-clearing paths above.
- **Anonymous.** Random install id, no personal data, no config contents. Coarse signals
  only: app version/OS, # workspaces, switches/day, which sensors/sources are used,
  crash counts, trial→license conversion. Enough for the developer to *see how it's used*,
  nothing identifying.
- **Batched & cheap.** Buffered locally, flushed infrequently over `NSURLSession` (respects
  the efficiency pillar — never chatty). Endpoint on the PureMac hub (§15).
- Because it's GPLv3 and opt-in, the whole scheme is transparent and auditable.

### 13b. Notifications system
- macOS user notifications via `UNUserNotificationCenter` for: trial expiry, the soft nag,
  update available, free-key confirmation, config errors, and (opt-in) "switched to
  workspace X". **Suppressed during meetings/Focus**; rate-limited; all individually
  toggleable. In-app banner equivalents for anything shown while the window is open.

## 14. Brand & design system

- **Logo:** teal waveform **tapering to nothing** on a slate squircle — literally the
  *fade* metaphor. Assets produced:
  - `assets/logo/fadeo-logo.png` (786×776, border removed) — README / in-app / marketing
  - `assets/logo/fadeo-logo-square-1024.png` — social / avatar
  - `assets/appicon/fadeo-appicon-1024.png` — app-icon master (keeps macOS safe margin;
    the AppIcon set / `.icns` is generated from it at M0)
- **Palette:** accent **teal `#67E4D2`**, surface **slate `#5A6A7A`**; derive a full
  tonal scale. **Dark-first** (matches the icon), full light mode too.
- **Motif:** the waveform taper reappears as the **fade-curve editor**, transition
  animations, and loading states — one visual language throughout.

---

## 15. Distribution & the PureMac hub

- **Home: `puremac.yashashwi.me`** — a clean, minimal storefront/hub (on the `yashashwi.me`
  domain) for the developer's Mac apps: **Fadeo**, **Tableau** (photo-widget for macOS),
  and future apps. One consistent, great-looking landing surface.
- **Fadeo is downloaded only from `puremac.yashashwi.me/fadeo`** going forward (not GitHub
  Releases for the *binary* — source stays on GitHub). The page hosts the download, the
  **Sparkle appcast**, purchase ($2), the **capped free-license generator**, and the
  **diagnostics ingestion** endpoint.
- **Signing:** Developer ID Application, **hardened runtime**, **non-sandboxed**.
- **Notarize:** `notarytool` submit → staple (no private-API scan — confirmed safe).
- **Auto-update:** [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org), EdDSA-signed appcast on the hub.
- **Bundle:** `mediaremote-adapter` framework + `.pl` + ambient presets in `Resources/`.
- Site work (storefront, license service, diagnostics dashboard) is **its own track**,
  post-M5 for the app; scoped separately. Recorded here so the app's licensing/diagnostics
  interfaces are designed to match from the start.

## 16. Project layout (SPM core + Xcode app)

```
Fadeo/
├─ Packages/FadeoCore/            # SPM — pure, 100% unit-tested (the correctness core)
│  ├─ Context / ContextPatch / ContextField
│  ├─ Workspace / Settings model + YAML codable + validator
│  ├─ resolve(Context,Workspaces,Settings)→Decision   # bands + tiebreak chain
│  ├─ Precedence simulator (same code the UI simulator calls)
│  └─ Reconciler (pure diff)
├─ Fadeo/                         # Xcode app target (dual activation policy)
│  ├─ App/                        # window + sidebar, MenuBarExtra, onboarding, license
│  ├─ Sensors/                    # AppFocus · Space(+CGS shim) · Meeting · Focus/Schedule
│  ├─ Actuators/                  # ExternalConductor · InternalEngine
│  ├─ Platform/                   # CGS shim · MediaRemote bridge · adapter runner · TCC
│  └─ Resources/                  # adapter · presets · AppIcon · Info.plist
├─ assets/                        # logo + appicon masters
└─ PLAN.md
```

Rationale: the part that must be *correct* (resolver + precedence) has no Mac in its
test loop; OS glue is thin and swappable.

## 17. Build order (milestones — each is a runnable app)

| M | Deliverable | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Full-app skeleton: **dual activation policy** (window ⇄ menu-bar agent), sidebar shell, `MenuBarExtra`, login-start (`SMAppService`), config load + hot-reload, **Energy dashboard / context inspector**, AppIcon from master | shell + "full app + companion" duality + efficiency baseline (idle≈0%) |
| **M1** | **Vertical slice:** Workspace model + AppFocus sensor + resolver + reconciler + `InternalEngine` with fades. Create a workspace, add an app, hear it work. | the whole pipeline end-to-end; first usable build |
| **M2** | **Precedence engine** (4 bands + tiebreak chain) + **Conflict Simulator**; `ExternalConductor` (MediaRemote + Spotify/Music) | the deep customization + conducting real players |
| **M3** ✅ | Remaining v1 sensors: Space (CGS shim) · Meeting (cam/mic) · Focus/Schedule (FSEvents + boundary timer). Also: real lazy sensor activation (a sensor starts only if an enabled workspace's `match` needs its fields) | all four triggers live |
| **M4** | Full **Workspace editor UI** + Sound Library + Precedence UI + menu-bar companion polish + two-way YAML editor | both halves of the customizability pillar |
| **M5** | **Licensing** (offline Ed25519, 14-day trial, $2, two-path soft nag) · opt-in **usage diagnostics** · **notifications** (`UNUserNotificationCenter`) · Sparkle updater · permissions wizard · notarization · **energy audit** · brand pass | shippable, paid, polished |
| Later | Idle · browser URL · network/SSID · battery · headphones · calendar sensors; preset library; per-output-device routing; workspace import/share | breadth |
| Site | **PureMac hub** (`puremac.yashashwi.me/fadeo`): storefront, download + Sparkle appcast, purchase, capped free-license generator, diagnostics dashboard | separate track, post-M5 |

## 18. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Private CGS Space symbols drift | version-guarded shim; degrade to "space changed, index unknown"; app-based workspaces keep working |
| Apple locks MediaRemote *commands* too | lean on AppleScript per-app control; InternalEngine unaffected; read-adapter already optional |
| AppleScript flakiness (Spotify `current track`) | prefer commands + our own desired-state tracker; never depend on read-back |
| Precedence feels mysterious to users | live "why this workspace" trace + Conflict Simulator + `weak`/`keepCurrent` knobs |
| Audio thrash on rapid switching | debounce + `enterDelay` + `minDwell` hysteresis, all tunable |
| OSS lets anyone strip the nag | expected (WinRAR honor system); paid = signed convenience + support; keep nag tasteful |
| Menu-bar/window SwiftUI inflates RSS | window lazy/released → back to `.accessory`; measured against ship gate |

## 19. Open questions (not blocking M0–M1)

- ~~Ambient preset library~~ — **DECIDED:** BYO (files/playlists + Spotify/Apple Music)
  first, with a bundled royalty-free starter set alongside.
- ~~Source license~~ — **DECIDED:** GPLv3 + paid key.
- `resumePrevious` fidelity across external players (exact track vs. just resume)?
- Multi-display Spaces: per-display workspaces, or the active display's space is *the* space?
- Workspace import/share format for a future community library.
